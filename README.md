# 🎬 Task 06 – Deep Fake Interview: Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse

## 🧠 Project Overview
For Task 06, I created a deep fake-style interview using AI-generated avatars and voices. The interview features a fictional sports reporter (myself, Kapil) speaking with "Coach Kaplan" about the performance of the Syracuse University Women’s Lacrosse team during the 2025 season.

This project builds directly upon Task 05, where I analyzed the team’s performance using descriptive statistics and natural language prompts. The narrative from that task served as the basis for scripting this interview.

## 🎯 Objective
To transform a data-driven narrative into a realistic, AI-generated audio-visual experience by:
- Writing an interview-style script
- Using AI tools to simulate realistic speech and avatars
- Documenting the entire creation process

---

## 🗣️ Script Summary
The dialogue includes:
- Reflections on SU’s 14–6 season record
- Tactical analysis of back-to-back losses in March
- Turnaround moments in April (win streak, player highlights)
- Offseason plans focused on accuracy and goalie improvement
- A prediction on next season’s breakout star (Sydney Reyes)

👉 Full script available in [`interview_script.md`](./interview_script.md)

## 🛠️ Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **ChatGPT (GPT-4)** | Script generation and iterative refinement |
| **Colossyan** | Deep fake video generation with dual avatars and natural voice synthesis |
| **GitHub** | Repository management and project submission |
| **Canva** *(optional)* | For thumbnail/title visual assets (if needed) |

## 🎥 Final Output
The final video, `deepfake_interview.mp4`, is **2 minutes and 32 seconds long**, and features a full interview simulation with two AI avatars, synchronized speech, and realistic delivery. It was created entirely using free or student-accessible tools under the Colossyan free plan.

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Reused structured statistical narrative from Task 05 (SU Women’s Lacrosse season).
2. Wrote a full 2-speaker interview script, identifying speaker turns.
3. Chose two avatars in Colossyan and assigned dialogue accordingly.
4. Adjusted pacing and voices to ensure clarity and realism.
5. Generated final video with AI voices and lip-sync avatars.
6. Uploaded all artifacts to a public GitHub repository.

## 🤖 Key Learnings

- Even free AI tools can generate surprisingly realistic interviews.
- Splitting roles across multiple avatars brings life to data storytelling.
- Planning structure and pacing is crucial to keep content within platform limits.
- Deepfake tools work best when the script is conversational and speaker labels are clearly defined.
